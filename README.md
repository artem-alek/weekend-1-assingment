  1. Create wireframe using div's as containers to get the proper framework of the site.

  1. I started off with inline-blocks and found out they were to hard to contain and match because of the inline element. Had to float left all the lists for a better result.
  2. Trying to understand how to get 4 div's to be evenly place in a 2x2 grid was a challenge. Had to manipulate a lot to get it just right.
