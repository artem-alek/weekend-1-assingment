  **Do a html and css mockup of the image 'normal.png'

***Steps Taken To Achieve This.
  1. Create wireframe using div's as containers to get the proper framework of the site.
  2. Fill in content that matches the sample picture along with background colors.
  3. Used a lot of un-order lists and and floated them.

***Some Challenges Faced.
  1. I started off with inline-blocks and found out they were to hard to contain and match because of the inline element. Had to float left all the lists for a better result.
  2. Trying to understand how to get 4 div's to be evenly place in a 2x2 grid was a challenge. Had to manipulate a lot to get it just right.
